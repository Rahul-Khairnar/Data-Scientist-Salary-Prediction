# Data-Scientist-Salary-Prediction
So i am using the glassdoors data about job prospects from various parts of USA for Data Scientist positions. Will use this data to train a model which will be able to determine
the salary of a particular job in a particular state based on the company's location, reviews, competitors and job role.
