## Data Scientist Salary Prediction: Project Overview
* Created a tool that estimates the salary that a particular Data Scientist role should get.   This will help the data scientists to negotiate their income during job interviews.
* Scraped about 1000 job descriptions from glassdoors.com using python selenium.
* Did data mining on the dataset gathered and looked out for keywords like Python, R, Excel,   Spark, AWS to get the prediction of the salaries as accurate as possible and reduce the       error.
* Created models like Random Forest, Multiple Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.
* Used GridSearchCV to optimize the performance of the model by tuning the parameters.
* Implemented the client facing API using Flask.
